* ''Content Analytics'' that organize and optimize content modules
** Machine learning method can help teachers organize massive open resources and teaching materials. Related fields are
*** Knowledge representation: extract relationships and build theasarus
*** Information retrieval: collect online resources
*** Knowledge graph: group and visualize complex content
** Examples
*** [[Gooru's Open Catalog|http://about.gooru.org/catalog]] is a rich content platform covers different subject areas
*** [[IBM Watson Content Analytics|https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5RWK_3.5.0/com.ibm.discovery.es.nav.doc/iiypofnv_prodover_cont.htm]] is an extensive knowledge graph
* ''Adaptive learning'' that track student knowledge and personalize instructions
** Machine learning can help with better assessment of individual student (esp. web-based) and adjust the teaching strategy. Related fields are
*** Reinforcement learning: optimizing the instruction/questioning policy
*** Statistics: robust and precise evaluation of student performance
*** Decision tree: a useful algorithm for categorizing student within least questions
** Examples: Adaptive learning systems: [[dreambox|http://www.dreambox.com]], [[ALEKS|https://www.aleks.com/about_aleks]], [[Knewton|http://www.knewtonhighered.com/]]
* Game-based learning: idk, maybe just games [[ST Math|https://web.stmath.com/]], [[Mangahigh|https://www.mangahigh.com/en-au/]]. Don't seem very educational
* Grading systems: score essays, detect plagiarism
** Machine learning could be very good at plagiarism detection and can be trained to know language (this is new)
*** Natural Language Processing can help finding mistakes in writing and grade answers
*** Deep learning can recognize writing styles, grade longer answers
** Examples: [[WriteToLearn|https://www.writetolearn.net/]], [[Lightside|http://turnitin.com/en_us/what-we-offer/revision-assistant]]
** Publication: [[The Eras and Trends of Automatic Short Answer Grading|http://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/publications/papers/stein_2015a.pdf]]
* Data analysis
** There are some data beyond education could be useful
*** Statistics can be used wherever there is data
*** Graph mining on structured data (network)
*** Embedding learning to represent complex data
** Examples:
*** predicting enrollment, dropouts, detecting student social connections and learning interests, good teaching behavior, office hour scheduling etc.

* [[A Survey of Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness|https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182]]

! Methods
* Theory first approach: formal, or logico-deductive, approach
** The elegance and rigor of definitions, abstractions, and formal proofs-ofproperties are of dominant concern
* Machine learning

! Applications
* program verification
** Behavioral consistency of C and Verilog programs using bounded model checking (2003)
* bug finding
** A few billion lines of code later: using static analysis to find bugs in the real world (2010)
* refactoring
** The ASTRÃ‰E analyzer (2005)

! Directions
* Make use of community: Open-source software systems such as Linux,MySQL, Django, Ant, and OpenEJB have become ubiquitous. These systems publicly expose not just source code, but also meta-data concerning authorship, bug-fixes, and review processes.
* Literate programming: The naturalness hypothesis [[NLP for SE]]

Checkerboard problem: No direct relationship exists among adjacent pixels. The up-sampled feature map generated by deconvolution can be considered as the result of periodical shuffling of multiple intermediate feature maps computed from the input feature map by independent convolutions.

To overcome this, use Pixel Deconvolutional Networks

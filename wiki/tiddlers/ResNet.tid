Residual connection were introduced by He et al. in [[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition|https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385]] in which they  give convincing theoretical and practical evidence for the advantages of utilizing additive merging of signals both for image recognition, and especially for object detection.

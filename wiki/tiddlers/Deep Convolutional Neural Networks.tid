The overall architecture of a DCNN consists of one or more layers of convolution followed by pooling followed by densely connected hidden layers and a softmax classifier.

The initial layers in a DCNN use convolutional layers in place of the standard fully-connected layers. [Baidu 15 Arxiv] use convolution and (max) pooling first layer architecture. The hyperparameters introduced are #convolutional

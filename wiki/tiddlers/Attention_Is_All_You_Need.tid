title: Attention Is All You Need
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

To prevent leftward information flow, all values in the input of the softmax are masked out.

! Remarks

* TODO: this attention should work with segmentation. (Probably too much computation, how does this compared to CRF?)
* TODO: attention in stock market?
* Multi-level attention for detection and other large scale memories?

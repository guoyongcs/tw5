! MI Team reading schedule
!! Guidelines

# The lecturer is encouraged to pick his own material, even beyond the list or our recent study fields, as long as he finds his topic more helpful to the group. If so, create your own entry in the list beforehand. You can find some interesting papers from
#* [[Arxiv Sanity Preserver|http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/]]
#* [[DeepMind Publications|https://deepmind.com/research/publications/]]
#* [[FAIR Publications|https://research.fb.com/publications/]]
#* [[Google Brain Publications|https://research.google.com/pubs/BrainTeam.html]]
# The lecturer is suggested to upload the slides to [[this git repo|https://g.hz.netease.com/mi-tools/mi-course/tree/dev/seminar]] before seminar. 
# The scribe should keep the notes of the seminar for later reference. A nice script format is `.pdf` or `.html`. Choosing between LaTeX/Markdown as the markup language according to the lecture content is strongly recommended. You may download the LaTeX template from [[here|https://g.hz.netease.com/mi-tools/mi-course/raw/dev/seminar/template.zip]].

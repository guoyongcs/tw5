Deep learning hard to generalize given few examples because there is no optimization techniques dedicated to this kind of problems. I will include ''rapid learning'' and ''continual learning'' literatures here.

''Meta-learning'' suggests we learn in 2 steps:

* acquire knowledge within each separate task (fast)
* extract information across all tasks (slow)

The goal of metal-learner is to acquire knowledge of different tasks. Consider a training algorithm

* input: training set $D_{train} = \{(X_t, Y_t)\}^T_{t=1}$
* output: parameters $\theta$ of model $M$
* obejctive: good performance on test set $D_{test} = (X, Y)$

Desire a meta-learning algorithm

* input: meta-training set $\mathcal D_{meta-train} = \{(D_{train}^{n}, D_{test}^n)\}_{n=1}^N$, where $D_{train}^{n}$ is a set of training set. Slow learning can be done by i.e. [[REINFORCE]].
* output: parameters $\Theta$ representing a training algorithm
* objective: good performance on meta-test set $\mathcal D_{meta-test} = \{(D_{train}^{n'}, D_{test}^{n'})\}_{n'=1}^{N'}$

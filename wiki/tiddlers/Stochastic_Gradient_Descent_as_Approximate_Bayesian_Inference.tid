title: Stochastic Gradient Descent as Approximate Bayesian Inference
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Modify SGD in the simplest way s.t. it becomes an efficient approximate Bayesian sampling algorithm
* Construct other sampling algorithms such as preconditioning, momentum or Polyak averaging

Constant SGD is a stationary stochastic process centered on the optimum and has a certain convariance structure. It is a hybrid of MC and variational algorithms.

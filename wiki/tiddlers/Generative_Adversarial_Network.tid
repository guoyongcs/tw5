!! Research Directions
* Generate HQ images. Image is a good field for generative models, because we are sensible to image plausibility.
** Higher resolution images can be generated in a multiscale fashion.
* Address GAN training difficulties
** [[Amortised MAP Inference for Image Super-resolution|https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04490]]
** [[Towards Principled Methods for Training Generative Adversarial Networks|https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04862]]
** When training GAN, we collpase distribution dimensionalities, but when the 2 distributions does not intersect, we get problem training. So we convolve the distribution and later recover the full distribution.
* Leverage Kullback-Leibler divergence
** Do maximum-likelihood estimation in a likelihood free setting. Similar to approximate Bayesian computation.
** The reverse of KL divergence, use GAN in Variational inference.
* More applications
** Text (large discrete ouput spaces)
** Reinforcement learning.
* Reducing variance?
** Many networks like GAN are stochastic, depends on a non-stationary sampling
** Look into RL literatures where value distribution depends on policy.

title: AdaDelta
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The benefits of Adadelta are as follows:

* No manual setting of a learning rate.
* Insensitive to hyperparameters.
* Separate dynamic learning rate per-dimension.
* Minimal computation over gradient descent.
* Robust to large gradients, noise and architecture choice.
* Applicable in both local or distributed environments.

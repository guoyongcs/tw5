title: Fast and Provably Good Seeding for k-Means
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Random seeding can lead to arbitrarily bad clustering result. K-means++ is slow.

A Markov chain sampling process with the stationary distribution exactly the same as k-means++ is proposed. The result is provably good without any assumptions of the data.

The performance is of up to 1,064x speedup and 1.32% relative error comparing to k-means++

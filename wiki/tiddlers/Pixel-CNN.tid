* [[Pixel-RNN|https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759]]
* [[Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders|https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328]]
** use horizontal stack with skip connection for current row, vertical stack for previous rows. no blind spot.
** 1xn and nxn masked convolution can be implemented by half-sized convs followed by a shift in pixels by padding and cropping.
** [[tensorflow implementation|https://github.com/anantzoid/Conditional-PixelCNN-decoder]]
* Pixel-CNN++
** OpenAI implementation with python3/tf. quite memory consuming (even though optimized from original implementation by logistic mixture sampling of pixels), 12G takes 12 in a batch.

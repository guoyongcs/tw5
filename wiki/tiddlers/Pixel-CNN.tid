** use horizontal stack with skip connection for current row, vertical stack for previous rows. no blind spot.
** 1xn and nxn masked convolution can be implemented by half-sized convs followed by a shift in pixels by padding and cropping.

* Generating interpretable images with controllable structure

! Implementations
* Pixel-CNN++
** OpenAI implementation with python3/tf. quite memory consuming (even though optimized from original implementation by logistic mixture sampling of pixels), 12G takes 12 in a batch.

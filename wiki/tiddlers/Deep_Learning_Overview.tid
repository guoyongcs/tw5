! Dealing non-linearity
Nonlinearity of problems like XOR popularized [[non-linear hidden layers|http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=104293]] and kernel methods.

Another well-known example is [[the parity problem|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)]]: although a single non-linear hidden layer is sufficient to represent any function, it is not guaranteed to represent it efficiently, can even require exponentially many more parameters than a deeper model.

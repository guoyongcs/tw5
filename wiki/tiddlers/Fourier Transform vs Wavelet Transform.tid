title: Fourier Transform vs Wavelet Transform
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Short time Fourier transform (STFT) suffers from resolution problem. We have equal time and frequency resolution at all frequencies in STFT.

Fourier modulus is unstable: high-frequency information spans a large linear subspace as soon as
there is non-rigid deformation. So we want to smooth along the orbits.

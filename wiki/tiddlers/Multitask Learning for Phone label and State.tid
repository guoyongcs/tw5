! Improving Speech Recognition

In [30], Seltzer and Droppo proposed to improve the recognition accuracy of the DNN-HMM system on the TIMIT phone recognition task [10] by adding a secondary task to the training of DNNs. For example, the digit recognition can be enhanced by training the network to simultaneously

* classify the digits
* enhance the noisy speech
* recognize the gender of the speaker

The secondary tasks they investigated are:

* Phone label task
* State context task
* Phone context task

Their results indicate that adding phone label classification as the secondary task does not affect the primary taskâ€™s result. This is understandable since the phone label does not provide any additional information than the state label already used in the primary task.

! Recognizing both Phonemes and Graphemes
[4] trains DNN with triphone model and trigrapheme model of the same language.
